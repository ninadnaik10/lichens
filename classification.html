            <p class="para1">Lichens are made up of three different living things. The fungus gives them their shape and
                holds them together. The algae gives them their color. The cyanobacteria give them their food. They are
                all different kinds of living things, so some scientists say they can't be classified together. But some
                scientists say they can, because they are all living together and they are all doing the same thing. So
                they have to be the same kind of living thing. 20% (one in five) of fungal species live in lichens.
                Lichen fungi belong to several different groups of fungi.</p>

            <p>Most common (over 40%) are Ascomycetes, which produce spores in a sac-shaped container, the ascus. Only a
                few types of alga occur within lichens; these algae also have their own names. Algae may be sometimes
                the dominant partner in so-called 'jelly lichens', Collema and Leptogium, but this is rare. More
                usually, the algae are the green alga Trebouxia. Other species are the orange Trentepohli, and the
                cyanobacterium Nostoc.</p>
