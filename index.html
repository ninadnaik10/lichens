            <p class="para1">Lichen is fascinating because it's actually two organisms, fungi and algae, wrapped up in
                one. These organisms have a symbiotic relationship with one another, meaning they rely on each other to
                survive and thrive. The outer portion of lichen is the fungus, which provides protection, support, and
                atmospheric moisture for the inside of lichen, which is algae. The algae (which is typically a
                cyanobacteria) photosynthesizes, making food for itself and the fungus. Because lichen gets all the food
                and nutrients it needs internally, lichen does not require nutrients from the tree it lives on. Like
                barnacles on a whale or a ship, the lichen just needs somethings to stick onto, which can include
                anything from trees to rocks to soil to even manmade objects like fences or metal scraps.</p>

            <p class="para1">But lichen is much more than just a harmless hitchhiker—it is an important part of our ecosystem. Lichen
                can break down rocks into smaller pieces, which is an essential step in soil formation. They also help
                with nutrient cycling in the soil, allowing plants and trees to grow. Wildlife such as deer and moose
                will graze on lichen during the winter when food is scarce, and birds will at times use lichen when
                constructing their nests.</p>
                <p class="para1">Lichen grows on healthy and unhealthy trees alike, but tends to be more commonly found on trees that are unhealthy or dead. This does not mean that the lichen is the cause tree's decline. In fact, it may be a blessing in disguise because it can bring attention to a tree that may not be in the best shape. Because the algae in lichen photosynthesizes to make food, lichen needs sunlight to survive and flourish. Therefore, lichen will grow more extensively on trees that have thinner canopy coverage because the trunk and branches get more sunlight. And, as we know, a tree with thin, declining canopy is typically a sign of distress.</p>

                <p>Lichens are regarded as pollution indicators because they are sensitive atmospheric pollution such as sulphur dioxide. They receive all their nutrients and water from wet and dry atmospheric deposition and do not grow in polluted areas. Their presence indicates the absence of pollution in an area, and their absence indicates that the area is polluted.</p>
